        <p>This peri peri chicken is made with my take on African peri peri sauce using fresh and dried chiles.</p>
        <P>The marinade is incredibly flavorful and gives the chicken a beautiful color as well. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>4 red Fresno chili peppers, seeded </li>
            <li>1 habanero pepper, seeded</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced red bell pepper, or other sweet pepper</li/img>
            <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mild olive oil, or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sherry vinegar</li>
            <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
            <li>4 chicken leg/thigh quarters</li>
            <li>kosher salt to taste to season chicken</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine garlic, Fresno chili peppers, habanero pepper, bell pepper, smoked paprika, thyme, kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, sugar, and onion powder in a blender.Pour in olive oil, sherry vinegar, and lemon juice; blend on high until marinade is completely smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour 3/4 of the marinade into resealable plastic bag set in a bowl. Reserve the rest for serving on the side.</li>
            <li>Make 3 or 4 shallow cuts into the skin side of the chicken quarters. This will allow the sauce to penetrate the skin during marination. Season chicken on both sides with kosher salt, and transfer into the bag. Seal the top, and toss and massage the chicken until all pieces are completely and evenly coated with the marinade. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator for 8 to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor charcoal grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade. Set skinside down onto the hot grill, using indirect heat. Cover to keep coals from getting too hot. Cook covered for about 5 minutes, then turn them over and grill another 10 to 12 minutes. Keep turning the chicken pieces, brushing with reserved marinade as desired, until they are cooked through - this can take up to 1 hour depending on grill temperature and size of chicken pieces.</li>
            <li>Serve with reserved sauce.</li>
        </ol>
